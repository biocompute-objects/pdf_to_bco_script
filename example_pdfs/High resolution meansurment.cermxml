        <p>Background: DUF1220 protein domains found primarily in Neuroblastoma BreakPoint Family (NBPF) genes show the greatest human lineage-specific increase in copy number of any coding region in the genome. There are 302 haploid copies of DUF1220 in hg38 (~160 of which are human-specific) and the majority of these can be divided into 6 different subtypes (referred to as clades). Copy number changes of specific DUF1220 clades have been associated in a dose-dependent manner with brain size variation (both evolutionarily and within the human population), cognitive aptitude, autism severity, and schizophrenia severity. However, no published methods can directly measure copies of DUF1220 with high accuracy and no method can distinguish between domains within a clade. Results: Here we describe a novel method for measuring copies of DUF1220 domains and the NBPF genes in which they are found from whole genome sequence data. We have characterized the effect that various sequencing and alignment parameters and strategies have on the accuracy and precision of the method and defined the parameters that lead to optimal DUF1220 copy number measurement and resolution. We show that copy number estimates obtained using our read depth approach are highly correlated with those generated by ddPCR for three representative DUF1220 clades. By simulation, we demonstrate that our method provides sufficient resolution to analyze DUF1220 copy number variation at three levels: (1) DUF1220 clade copy number within individual genes and groups of genes (gene-specific clade groups) (2) genome wide DUF1220 clade copies and (3) gene copy number for DUF1220-encoding genes. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first method to accurately measure copies of all six DUF1220 clades and the first method to provide gene specific resolution of these clades. This allows one to discriminate among the ~300 haploid human DUF1220 copies to an extent not possible with any other method. The result is a greatly enhanced capability to analyze the role that these sequences play in human variation and disease.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>
        Highly duplicated sequences, including genes, are
prevalent throughout the human genome [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. While they have
been linked to important evolutionary [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref3">2, 3</xref>
        ] and medical
phenotypes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ], they often go unexamined in studies of
genetic disease due to their complexity. Thus, there is a
growing need to develop improved strategies for accurate
copy number determination of highly duplicated
sequences. While a number of methods exist for scoring
copy number variations (CNVs) (e.g. array comparative
genomic hybridization (arrayCGH), SNP arrays, qPCR,
ddPCR and read depth from exome sequencing) these
methods are not ideal for high-resolution measurement of
DUF1220 domains due to limitations in throughput,
accuracy and/or coverage. The primary challenge for both
array based methods and exome sequencing lies in the
hybridization efficiency of each probe with its respective
target and thus causing variance and resulting uneven
coverage, systematic bias, and inaccuracy of the
measurement [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5 ref6">5, 6</xref>
        ]. More recently the use of whole genome
sequencing (WGS) to estimate copy number by sequence
read depth has become more prevalent with the increasing
availability of WGS datasets. However, accurate copy
number estimation for highly duplicated sequences
remains a challenge [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ] and, as a result, many CNV methods
mask highly duplicated sequences and segmental
duplications from the analysis [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5 ref8 ref9">5, 8, 9</xref>
        ]. Furthermore, previous
reports have focused largely on measurement of gene copy
number changes but sequences can vary as a result of
both gene dosage changes and intragenic domain
expansion/contraction. Consideration of this fact is important
for two reasons. First, intragenic sequence gains or losses
can confound estimates of gene copy number, and second,
changes in copy number arising from intragenic changes
may have different phenotypic effects than those arising
from gene dosage changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the most interesting examples of highly
duplicated human genome sequences are those encoding
DUF1220 protein domains. Sequences encoding DUF1220
domains show the greatest human lineage-specific increase
in copy number of any protein coding region in the genome
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. The copy number of DUF1220 shows a dramatic
increase specifically among anthropoid primates (monkeys,
apes and humans), with the most extreme increase in copy
number occurring in the human lineage (humans: ~300
haploid copies; great apes: 97–138; monkeys: 48–75; all other
mammals: 1–9) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref11">10, 11</xref>
        ]. Our lab and others have previously
shown that among primate species, an increase in copy
number is associated, in a DNA dose-dependent manner,
with an evolutionary increase in brain size, cortical neuron
number and several other brain-related phenotypes [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref12 ref13 ref14">11–14</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        The great majority of human DUF1220 domains are
encoded by the NBPF gene family [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ], map primarily to
the 1q21 region in humans, and can be subdivided into
six different subtypes, or clades, based on sequence
similarity [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ]. Three of the clades are conserved across
primates (CON1–3) and three show intragenic copy
number increases specific to the human lineage (HLS1–3).
Interestingly the clades follow a generally fixed
arrangement within each NBPF gene: From 5′ to 3′ (from
Nterminus to C-terminus in the predicted protein) they
almost always occur in the following order: CON1,
CON2, HLS1, HLS2, HLS3, and CON3 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ]. In human
populations, copies of DUF1220 sequences show a
Gaussian distribution that represents a rich, and largely
unexamined, source of functional allelic variation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that the measurement of clade-specific copy
number is essential because increases in the copy number
of specific DUF1220 clades have been correlated with
several important cognitive phenotypes. These include
gray matter volume in a non-disease human population
(CON1 and CON2) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ], autism severity (CON1) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18">17, 18</xref>
        ],
schizophrenia severity (CON1 and HLS1) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
        ] and
cognitive aptitude (CON2) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ]. These associations would be
obscured if only total DUF1220 copy number or NBPF
gene copy number was examined. Gene-specific
resolution is also important, as knowledge of which DUF1220
domains are changed in copy number, where they are
located, and how they changed (gene duplication/deletion
or intragenic domain expansion/contraction) may be
critical to identifying relationships between copy number
and disease. In addition to measuring gene copy number
and genomic DUF1220 clade copy number, this requires
the measurement of DUF1220 domain copy number
within each gene.
      </p>
      <p>
        While other groups have measured CNVs from WGS
data, measurement of the NBPF genes and DUF1220
domains has been limited and to our knowledge, none
have reported on clade specific copy number of DUF1220
domains. We know of two studies that have reported
NBPF gene copy number variation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ] and one reporting
DUF1220 copy number variation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ]. These studies were
limited in their scope and resolution of NBPF gene copy
number. Sudmant et al. (2010) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ] reported on only 9 of
the 24 NBPF genes, while Sudmant et al. (2015) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ]
reported population stratification of NBPF gene copy
number without specifying which NBPF genes were involved.
Sudmant et al. (2013) [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
        ] reported on DUF1220 copy
number within NBPF10 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>
        ], however the values reported
are consistent with haploid genome-wide DUF1220 copy
number rather than NBPF10 DUF1220 copy number.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the basis of accurate quantification of read depth and
copy number estimation lies the alignment strategy that is
used to map reads back the genome reference. Previous
studies have utilized a strategy which finds all possible
alignments for each read has been used often [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref24 ref25">21, 24, 25</xref>
        ].
In brief, this strategy tries to maximize read ambiguity and
cross alignment between different duplicated segments by
shortening longer reads to 36 bp single-end reads and
finding all possible alignments within two mismatches.
The strength of this method is that it provides an
aggregate measure of highly duplicated sequences as was
demonstrated by Sudmant et al. 2010 [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ]. However, this
method lacks specificity within highly homologous
segmental duplications. This can be partially addressed by
the use of Singly Unique Nucleotides (SUN) identifiers
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
        ], as long as there are enough diagnostic SUN
positions for each region. Due to their highly-duplicated
nature, many DUF1220 domains lack single base differences
so they would not be measured with a SUN-based
approach. Another limitation of the strategy of finding all
possible alignments is that it is seven times slower than
finding the best alignment and the resulting alignment
files are often two orders of magnitude larger. We set out
to test the accuracy and resolution of DUF1220 copy
number measurement that can be obtained with this
method and explore the possibility of aligning longer
reads with increased specificity. The specificity would
allow for the quantification of individual domains and
DUF1220 sequences within genes.
      </p>
      <p>In this study, we explore how these strategies and
various sequencing parameters affect the accuracy and
precision of copy number estimation and demonstrate
a method in which copies of DUF1220 and DUF1220
encoding genes can be accurately estimated. We
validate this method with simulations, ddPCR, and apply it
to data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We
demonstrate not only the accurate estimation of
DUF1220clade specific copies, but also the delineation of clades,
and in some cases domains, within individual NBPF genes.
Such information allows one to determine if variations are
due to changes in the copy number of whole genes or
intragenic domain copy number expansions or contractions
within specific individual NBPF genes. Together these
advances allow us to utilize whole genome sequence data to
identify copy number changes in DUF1220 sequences
with unprecedented accuracy and precision, allowing
potential disease associations to be examined at the highest
level of resolution so far reported.</p>

        <p>
          Because some of the ~300 DUF1220 copies in the haploid
human genome display high sequence similarity to one
another [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
          ], it is likely that some sequence reads will map
equally well to multiple locations. To further understand
the relationship and sequence conservation between each
of the 24 NBPF genes and respective domains or subtypes,
we performed a detailed annotation of the NBPF genes in
the most recent version of the human genome (hg38). We
then used the sequences to carry out a detailed sequence
analysis and clustering (Fig. 1). We have included the 8
predicted NBPF pseudogenes (as annotated in hg38) in our
analysis as their domains may have impacts not related
to their coding potential (e.g. substrates for
homologous recombination, targets of DNA or RNA binding
proteins). Application of the method described in this
paper to future analysis of variation and disease
associations allows one to measure the DUF1220 domains of
pseudogenes separately from those that are predicted to
be protein-encoding.
        </p>
        <p>To develop our methodology for measuring DUF1220
copies, we wanted to determine the extent to which this
read alignment ambiguity occurs. We carried out a
simulation in which 100 bp paired-end reads from each
DUF1220 domain were generated from the human
reference genome, hg38, and aligned back to the reference
to determine the extent to which reads from each
domain (CON1, CON2, CON3, HLS1, HLS2, and HLS3)
selectively align to the correct gene and clade. We
found that, with 100 bp paired-end reads, the DUF1220
sequences from eight genes can be uniquely measured;
100% of the reads originating from them align to the
originating gene and clade (e.g. NBPF7) (Fig. 2). In
other cases, a proportion of the reads align equally well
to two or more genes that have high sequence similarity
(e.g. NBPF4, NBPF5P &amp; NBPF6) (Fig. 2). Simulations
involving 300 and 600 bp paired-end reads could not
resolve the domains within NBPF4, NBPF5P, and
NBPF6. If not accounted for, this read alignment
ambiguity would result in over- or under- estimates of
genespecific clade copy number.</p>
        <p>To address the challenge of read alignment ambiguity,
we observed from our simulation that show read sharing
is restricted to small clusters of genes and not
distributed across all genes. By grouping related genes together
for analysis, one can maintain accuracy and improve our
resolution of copies within a clade. For example, we
calculate the number of CON1 domains from NBPF4,
NBPF5, and NBPF6 together because they share a high
percentage of their reads. Likewise, domains from
NBPF10, NBPF14, NBPF19, and NBPF20 share
alignment ambiguity, so copies for these genes can be
aggregated. As described below, this approach substantially
reduces the error in copy number measurement.
Additional file 1: Table S1 shows a strategy for grouping
related genes into 60 categories based on the results from
the simulated data for 100 bp paired end reads (Fig. 2).
While grouping genes with high read sharing reduces
resolution, the level of resolution obtainable with 100 bp
paired-end reads is still an improvement over existing
methods. The most appropriate gene groups to use for
any given analysis will depend on the goals of the
researcher (e.g. whether accuracy or resolution is a priority)
and the sequence data available, as longer paired-end
reads should improve the ability to localize reads to the
correct gene (and vice versa for shorter sequencing reads).</p>

        <title>Establishment of four levels of DUF1220 measurement</title>
        <p>Based on the read alignment ambiguity shown in Fig. 2,
we differentiated four levels of resolution at which
DUF1220 copy number can be measured; 1) Domain level
measures are of each individual DUF1220 domain, i.e.
alignment to a precise genomic location, 2) Gene-specific
clade level measures are of all domains from a particular
clade that occur within each DUF1220-encoding gene, i.e.
reads align to a particular clade within an NBPF gene
(Additional file 1: Table S1) 3) Group-specific measures
are of all domains from a particular clade that occur
within gene grouping as described above (Additional file
1: Table S1), 4) Clade-specific measures are all DUF1220
domains belonging to each of the 6 different DUF1220
clades.</p>

        <title>Evaluation of read length and paired-end reads on quantification of DUF1220 copies</title>
        <p>In order to measure DUF1220 copies, we need to
determine which kind of sequencing data would be most
applicable and how sequencing parameters may influence
the accuracy and precision of the measurement.
Previous strategies have relied on very short 36 bp reads, we
hypothesized that longer reads would improve accuracy
of copy number prediction. To address this, we
compared the effect of read length, as well as single and
paired-end reads, on the accuracy of our read depth
estimate based on simulated data. We simulated reads
from the sequences of each of the DUF1220 domains
based on the human reference genome hg38 and
aligned these back to the genome along with additional
levels of the reads spiked in. The simulated read
lengths were 36, 100, 150 or 300 bp long, both
singleand paired end. For each of the read lengths, we
compared the predicted and measured coverage and report
the combined root mean squared error (RMSE) of the
prediction for each of the four different levels of
resolution (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the average RMSE for
domains within each gene when 100 bp, paired-end
reads are utilized. A potential limitation of calculating
the RMSE for the spike-in study is that the variances
may not scale linearly for domains where the off-target
alignment rate is high. In some cases we observed that
the absolute difference between the measured and
simulated copy numbers to increase with increasing
simulated coverage. By using the relative ratio between
measured and simulated copy numbers the respective
off-target alignments remain the same and are
compared consistently throughout the entire simulation
experiment (e.g. if for a particular domain, 10% of the
reads align off target, one would measure a copy
number of 0.9 for 1 simulated copy, and a copy number of
4.5 for 5 simulated copies. Both represent an increase
in the absolute difference, but measure 90% of the</p>

        <p>The data shown in Table 1 illustrate the accuracy of the
copy number estimation based on simulated reads from

        <p>The simulation was conducted ten times and the
measured number of copies was compared with the known
copies. This allows for the quantitative comparison of
‘offtarget’ alignment rates at the level of domain, gene, group
and clade shown in Table 2.</p>
        <p>
          Overall the ‘best’ alignment strategy outperformed
the other methods. For 566 total diploid DUF1220
copies, the ‘best’ alignment method was off by an average
of 3.7 copies, the multiread correction method was off
by 7.7, and the total alignment strategies were off by
hundreds of copies. While the multiread correction
method was competitive in terms of accuracy, it was
the least computationally efficient. The ‘Align All’
method with mrsFast [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
          ] performed better for CON2
than with other domains, which is likely due to the
conservation of the sequence across genes. If NBPF3,
NBPF13P, and NBPF17P are excluded, the error for
CON2 estimate by ‘Align All’ drops to 0.08, which is
lower than the ‘best’ alignment strategy.
        </p>
        <p>While the ‘Align All’ strategy was good at summarizing
copies of CON1 and CON2 at the clade level, where 0%
of the reads were found as off-target alignment, it lacked
the ability to resolve copy number estimates below the
clade level (e.g. if an extra CON2 domain was detected
at the clade level, it would be difficult to tell from which
gene it came) (Table 2). The ‘Align All’ strategy
underestimated CON1 copy number, which is likely caused by
reads not uniformly aligning to all domains (Fig. 5). For
clades CON3, HLS1, HLS2 and HLS3, the ‘Align All’
strategy had a much higher off-target percentage than
the ‘Best Align’ strategy (25–40% vs 0.5–7%) and the
estimated copy numbers were higher than expected. This
is likely due to the sequence similarity between CON3
and the HLS clades. Thus, it is likely that HLS domains
inflated the measure of CON3 and of themselves. The
ambiguity among HLS domains was much higher when
using the Bowtie1 for the ‘Align All’ strategy. If we
normalize the HLS clades by the total number of HLS1,
HLS2, HLS3 copies, we can reduce the observed error to
46.8 overall DUF1220 copies. While the overall accuracy
increases, it comes at the cost of distinguishing between
HLS clades. Perhaps with an improved normalization
scheme, the error in the copy number estimates from
the ‘Align All’ strategies could be further reduced,
however it is unlikely to be able to distinguish beyond the
clade level.</p>

        <title>Validation by ddPCR</title>
        <p>
          The accuracy of our read depth method, and the ability
to detect changes in copy number, were evaluated by
comparing the read depth generated copy numbers of
three DUF1220 clades (CON1, CON2 and HLS3) with
the copy numbers measured by ddPCR (Fig. 6). We
believe these three subtypes provide the best validation
for the WGS estimates for the following reasons.
Previously published ddPCR data for CON1 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref19">17–19</xref>
          ], CON2
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
          ], and HLS1 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref18 ref19">17–19</xref>
          ] suggested that measuring
CON1, CON2, and one of the HLS clades would capture
the range of copy numbers seen by all 6 DUF1220
clades. Any one of the HLS clades is likely to have a very
similar copy number range as the others because, in
hg38, they almost always occur as a triplet. HLS3 was
chosen to represent the HLS clades for validation of our
method because it has a lower off-target alignment rate
than HLS1 and HLS2 (Table 2) Likewise, the off target
alignments for CON1 and CON2 are zero at the clade
level which make them ideal candidates for comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have previously optimized the use of ddPCR for
measurement of DUF1220 clade copy number and shown that
the method is highly reproducible [

samples from MPIMG, the p-value for the correlation
between read depth and ddPCR for the HLS3 clade was
0.13. However, for the same samples, the p-value for the
correlation between read depth and ddPCR for total
HLS (HLS1, HLS2, and HLS3 combined) is 0.03. This
improvement is likely due to the fact that combining the
three HLS domains improves the accuracy of the read
depth measurement, as there is a high degree of sequence
similarity between HLS1, HLS2, and HLS3. Because there
were only 4 samples in our analysis for MPIMG, the small
change in read depth accuracy has a large effect on the
p-value for these centers (but only a small effect on the
p-value for samples from SC).</p>

low mean insert size of these samples (226 bp whereas
the others was between 450 and 500 bp). Due to this
low correlation, we excluded these samples from further
analysis in this study and recommend that samples from
this sequencing center not be used in future read-depth
based analysis of DUF1220 copy number. The agreement
between ddPCR and read depth generated copy numbers
for the remaining sequencing centers suggest that our

single unique match within one mismatch using Bowtie1,
producing a set of unique regions within and around the
coding portion of each NBPF gene (Additional file 3). To
generate our estimates of gene copy number, we excluded
any regions within the coding portion of the gene to avoid
the possibility of intragenic changes affecting our
genelevel estimate. We also excluded some untranslated exons
(UTR) at the 5’ and 3’ ends of genes because our results
indicated that these may reflect copy number changes of
specific upstream or downstream regions that are not due
to gene copy number changes. The average normalized
read depth across these unique regions was calculated to
estimate the gene copy number of each of these genes.
Our gene copy number estimates are largely in agreement
with those previously reported [

elevated mean copy number and high variability for NBPF1

NBPF1 of approximately 4 to 15 copies. We found that the
sequence currently annotated as LOC102724250 on an
un-placed contig, chr1_KI270711v1_random, is an NBPF
gene with high similarity to NBPF1, which we refer to as

equivalent range (NBPF1 plus NBPF1L) is ~4 to ~11
copies which is fairly close to the range reported by Sudmant,

within and surrounding the coding portion of NBPF1, we
found that some regions upstream of the coding sequence
have copy numbers much greater than the regions closest
to the coding sequence (Additional file 2: Figure S3),
suggesting duplication of these regions independently of the
protein-coding portion of the gene. We have excluded
these regions from Fig. 8 where we report the gene copy

          To further validate our read-depth method, we compared
our copy number estimates with those published
previously [

          ] for select multi-copy genes (NSF, KIAA1267)
using the same 1000 Genomes Project samples as those in
the comparison study. Values we obtained were
highlycorrelated with those previously reported (the Pearson
correlation coefficient was 0.92 for NSF and 0.95 for
KIAA1267). We also found that while our read

number among 1000 Genomes samples are similar to
those previously reported [

our read depth and ddPCR estimates were very similar for

were more concordant than the values previously

copy number between our study and Sudmant (2010) [

where the majority of NBPF genes reside. The hg38
assembly includes a better annotation of NBPF14, where
NBPF14 expanded from 2 HLS triplets (in hg19) to 7
triplets in hg38. NBPF14 sequences were either missing
from the genome reference or were improperly assigned

      <p>
        We describe a novel approach for the copy number
measurement of DUF1220 protein domain family sequences
and the genes that encode them (primarily NBPF) from
WGS data. While some DUF1220 copies are
indistinguishable from one another [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
        ], the method described
allows the 302 haploid copies of DUF1220 (hg38) to be
accurately quantified at multiple levels of increased
resolution (clade, group-specific clade, and in some cases,
individual domains).
      </p>
      <p>
        Through computational simulations, we were able to
identify the sequencing and alignment parameters that
lead to optimal measurement of DUF1220 copy number
in NBPF genes. When we tested multiple alignment
strategies for their alignment rates, accuracy and precision and
observed different levels of performance for the different
methodologies used. The alignment strategies tested had
different strengths. For example, the ‘Align All’ strategy
worked well to summarise the overall copies of CON1
and CON2 domains where zero off-target alignments
were detected. However, errors were much higher for
CON3 and HLS1–3 due to greater sequence similarity
amongst domains from these clades. The off-target rates
for these domains were between 25 and 50%. This effect
can be partially mitigated by the ‘Best Align’ strategy.
Among our key findings was the determination that
longer sequence read-lengths increased our ability to reliably
follow copy number changes for specific DUF1220
domains. This may seem obvious, but it differs from a
commonly employed model that shortens reads to
36 bp [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21 ref24 ref25">21, 24, 25</xref>
        ]. We also determined that, while it is
difficult to accurately measure most individual
DUF1220 domains, we can accurately quantify the
number of domains within each clade and within each
gene (or small group of genes). The strategy of finding
all possible alignments for each read as a
summarization strategy was found to be inaccurate due
to the heterogeneous nature of the sequence similarity
of the domains. Finding the best possible alignment for
each read and choosing among the ties at random was
the most accurate and the most computationally
efficient strategy. The ‘best’ alignment strategy along with
the use of long sequencing reads allowed for the
highest specificity and lowest off-target alignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        To our knowledge, this is the first high-throughput
method that allows DUF1220 copy number to be
measured with clade-specific resolution, and the first method
to measure clade copy number within specific NBPF
genes. The ability to obtain clade-specific resolution has
considerable significance in that variation in the copy
number of specific DUF1220 clades has previously been
shown to be associated with important phenotypic
variation related to brain size [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref12 ref13 ref14 ref27">11–14, 27</xref>

        ] and
cognitive function [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
        ], and this method should allow
future studies to be carried out with greatly increased speed
and cost-effectiveness relative to previous methods
(e.g. aCGH, ddPCR). For example, the large WGS
datasets that are being generated for autism [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28 ref29">28, 29</xref>
        ]
and other brain-related disorders should provide a
rich resource to which the DUF1220 read depth
approach can be applied. Applications of this method to
study the biological variation of DUF1220 across the
human population are currently underway and will be
reported in follow on publications.

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The significance of the work presented here is in the
development and validation of a computational, WGS
strategy to estimate copies of DUF1220 domains, at the clade,
gene, and domain level. As we demonstrate, previously
published computational methods for measuring CNVs
lack the ability to resolve DUF1220 into clades or other
smaller groupings. The method we describe here is a great
improvement to the published methods through improved
alignment and summarization strategies. The ability to
measure gene-specific clade groups allows researchers to
test hypotheses related to the effects of DUF1220 changes
in specific NBPF genes, which may reveal important
disease associations not previously open to investigation.
Because we can also determine gene copy number
independently of DUF1220 domain number, this method
allows the researcher to discriminate between CNVs
involving gene duplication/deletion events and changes
involving duplications/deletions of exons within a gene.
Since DUF1220 domains show the greatest human
lineage-specific copy number increase of any coding
region of the genome, the strategies employed here and the
insights we obtained should serve to guide other efforts to
use read depth to measure copy number of highly
duplicated sequences. The result of the work presented here is
a greatly enhanced capability to analyze the role that these
sequences play in human variation and disease. This
method can find additional applications in high-resolution
analysis of other multi-copy gene families and of genes
containing multiple duplicated domains, though this was
outside of the immediate scope of the work presented here.</p>

        <title>Simulation studies</title>
        <p>To assess the degree of read alignment ambiguity between
DUF1220 domains, a ‘spike-in’ study was conducted,
where reads from an individual domain were simulated
and aligned back to the genome. Single and paired-reads,
ranging in lengths from 36 bp to 300 bp, were randomly
sampled from the reference genome (hg38). To simulate
duplication or deletion events, the number of reads were
varied to simulate one to ten copies of each DUF1220
domain. To obtain reads for a single domain, reads
overlapping a DUF1220 domain of interest were isolated and
aligned back to the genome using each of the alignment
strategies below. Afterwards we compared the degree to
which reads aligned to the expected location.</p>
        <p>To assess the ability of each algorithm to account for all
271 haploid DUF1220 copies, a ‘baseline’ study was
conducted where all canonical DUF1220 domains were
simulated at diploid coverage and aligned back to the genome.
Reads were simulated as described for the ‘spike-in’ study
but with 100 bp paired-end reads. 100 bp paired-end reads
were chosen because this is the sequencing length and
type available from the 1000 Genomes Project.</p>
        <p>For both simulation studies, the number of reads was
adjusted to give a baseline diploid coverage of 30×. For
paired-end reads the insert size was varied to match the
variation found in the 1000 Genomes Project, normally
distributed with a mean insert size of 350 bp and a
standard deviation of 50 bp.</p>
        <p>
          Sequencing errors and quality scores could potentially
increase the ambiguity of each read and impact the
ability to distinguish between DUF1220 domains.
Quality scores from Illumina sequence data tend to decrease
towards the end of each read. To model this, we
measured the mean quality score at each base for the 1000
Genomes fastq files and used loess regression to model
the distribution. The profile was extended so that each
simulated read length would have the same quality score
profile. This was done to simulate the quality score drop
off rate relative to read length observed in data obtained
from different generations of Illumina sequencers (GAIIx,
HiSeq2000, MiSeq, etc). Each sequencing pair was
modeled separately, since the second read tends to have
lower quality scores than the first. Sequencing errors were
modeled as described in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>
          ]. The mean probability for a
sequencing error for the first read was 0.0026 and 0.004
for the second pair. The error rate was increased linearly
such that the probability of a sequencing error was 1.5
times more likely at the end of the read and 1/2 as likely
at the beginning of the read.

          For alignment to the human genome reference, we
tested various alignment strategies. Bowtie2 (version 2.2.9)
[
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
          ] was used to find the ‘best’ alignment for each read,
with the ‘–very-sensitive’ preset and a max-insert size of
800 bp. For the ‘All Align’ strategy, mrsFast-Ultra (version
3.3.11) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>
          ] was used as described in [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>
          ], with the
parameters ‘–crop 36’ and ‘-e 2’ to crop 100 bp reads to 36 bp
and aligned with up to two mismatches. As an alternative,
Bowtie (version 1.1.2) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
          ] was also used for the ‘All Align’
strategy, with the following parameters ‘–all -v 2 -X 800’.
For the multiread strategy, reads were aligned to the
genome using Bowtie v1.1.2 with the ‘–best –strata –all –v 2’
parameters. In this case, Bowtie attempts to find the best
possible alignment for each read. If multiple valid
alignments are found, rather than choosing one at random, all
ties are returned. Later the contribution of each read can
be weighted as described below.
        </p>
        <p>
          After alignment, the BAM files were converted to BED
format using bedtools (v2.17.0) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
          ]. Paired-end reads
aligned as a proper pair were joined into a single fragment
and discordant pairs were treated as single-end reads. The
lengths of the discordant reads were extended to half mean
insert size for that sample following a normal distribution.
The resulting fragments were then intersected with each
DUF1220 domain using bedtools. For the multi-read
correction, the resulting BED file was sorted by read name and
the number of bases overlapping with each DUF1200
domain was divided by the number of places each read
aligned. The coverage for each DUF1220 domain was
calculated by dividing the number of bases overlapping the
domain by the domain length. The number of copies of
each domain was calculated by dividing the coverage by the
expected simulated haploid coverage, in this case 15×
coverage. For the ‘Align All’ strategy, the copy number was
further normalized by the total number of domains for each
clade. The Root Mean Squared Error was calculated by the
following formula: RMSE = sqrt(sum((measured.copies –
expected.copies)^2))

was obtained from ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/
ftp/data_collections/. Approximately 25 individuals were
randomly chosen from each of the CEU, YRI, CHB, JPT,
MXL, CLM, PUR, ASW, LWK, CHS, TSI, IBS, FIN, and
GBR populations for a total of 324 individuals.
Individuals from the CEU, YRI, CHB, and JPT populations were
selected to match with those reported previously [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>
          ].
The data were obtained from the Illumina 2000 with
100 bp paired-end reads, with an average of 139 million
reads and 15× coverage per genome. The reads were
filtered and trimmed to remove low quality bases (Phred
score &lt; 10) from the 3′ ends of the read using Cutadapt
(version 1.31) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>
          ] (cutadapt –a XXX –A XXX –q 10
–minimum-length 80 –trim-n). Reads trimmed shorter
than 80 bases were removed (on average 18.5 million
reads per sample). Samples with less than 10× coverage
were removed from the analysis. Coverage was
calculated by multiplying the number of filtered reads by the
insert size and dividing by the number of bases in the
human genome reference. The sequence data were
analyzed following the ‘best’ align strategy as described
above and outlined in Fig. 9. For copy number
estimation, the genomic coordinates spanning the short and
long exons of each DUF1220 domain were combined.
Where the domains were more than 1 kb apart, the
boundaries of the domains were extended up to 250 bp
to allow the possibility of capturing unique sequence
directly adjacent to the domain. Sequence coverage for
each region of interest is then normalized by dividing
the coverage for every region of interest by the mean
coverage of highly conserved regions and multiplying
the normalized value by a GC correction factor. To
derive GC correction factors, the genome including
highlyconserved regions were binned into 1 kb windows and
the read depth is plotted against the %GC content. A
Loess regression model is fitted to the data to determine
the correction factor for each GC bin. The background
regions used for normalization and GC correction
were derived by merging regions from our
simulations that map uniquely to the human genome
reference within two mismatches along with regions from
the database of Ultra-Conserved Elements (UCE)
[

        <title>Annotation of DUF1220 domains and DUF1220 containing genes in hg38</title>
        <p>
          Identification of DUF1220 domains
The genomic coordinates of DUF1220 domains in the
reference genome are required to carry out WGS read
depth. To identify DUF1220 domains and their genomic
coordinates, we utilized HMMER version 3.1b2 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
          ] and
components of a pipeline published by Zimmer &amp;
Montgomery (2015) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>
          ]. Briefly, HMMER was used to
generate a hidden markov model based on the DUF1220
(PF06758) seed domains present in the pfam database as
of July 10th, 2017 (Additional file 4) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
          ]. This hidden
markov model was then used to search the longest
isoforms of all proteins in the human proteome (Ensemble
v.81) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
          ] for matching domains with an expectation
value (E-value) less than 1e−10. The cDNA sequences
corresponding to the protein domain hits were then
aligned with MAFFT and this alignment was used to
generate a nucleotide hidden markov model. The
nucleotide hidden markov model was then used to search
the reference genome (hg38) for DUF1220 domains with
an expectation value (E-value) less than 1e−10, producing
a list of genomic coordinates for DUF1220 domains in
the reference genome. Custom scripts were used to
convert the HMMER output files to bed files, appropriately
account for both exons in a DUF1220 domain, and
assign DUF1220 domains to the appropriate clade.
Locations of DUF1220 domains in hg38
Consistent with the results presented by Zimmer and
Montgomery (2015), we identified 302 DUF1220 domains
in hg38 using HMMER. A complete list of DUF1220
domain coordinates can be found in Additional file 5.
Refseq (GCF_000001405.35_GRCh38.p9_genomic.gff )
and Ensembl (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.86.gtf) exon
annotations differ slightly for the DUF1220 containing genes.
For each gene, the reference annotation that most
completely matches the known structure of DUF1220 domains
was used. If both references were identical with respect to
DUF1220 exon annotation, the reference with the greater
number of UTR exons was utilized.
        </p>
        <p>
          DUF1220 domains are known to be composed of an
exon doublet consisting of a short and long exon of
characteristic length. We observed that the
coordinates returned by HMMER overlapped only single
exons (the long exon). This is likely because the search
algorithm is unable to identify the N-terminal end of
the domain (encoded by the small exon) across the
intronic gap. We confirmed that in almost every case,
the short (50 – 111 bp) exon immediately preceding
the exon identified by the HMMER coordinates codes
for the N-terminus of the DUF1220 domains. Our
custom scripts annotate each appropriate exon pair as
belonging to the same DUF1220 domain.
Assignment of DUF1220 domains to appropriate clade
As previously described, the majority of DUF1220
domains can be divided into 6 clades [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>
          ]. The domains of
each clade can be distinguished by their position within
the gene, their exon lengths (Additional file 5), and
protein sequence motifs unique to each clade (Additional file
6). We assigned each DUF1220 domain to a clade based
on the presence or absence of these characteristic protein
sequence motifs. The validity of our clade assignments
can be confirmed by viewing a phylogenetic tree of the
protein sequences (Fig. 1). Furthermore, because the
amino-acid motifs particular to each clade are highly
conserved within clades, it is easy to view the distinctions
between clades by viewing the aligned protein sequences
(Additional file 6).
        </p>
        <p>Some (16/302) DUF1220 domains do not fit well
within the previously established clades, but clearly
form 5 distinct clusters based on sequence similarity.
We have therefore established five new clades referred
to as CON4–8 (Additional file 5). In contrast to the
domains belonging to the six clades described above,
the majority of these DUF1220 domains are located
between 1p11.2 and 1p13.3. These were not analyzed in
this study because of their non-canonical nature and
their locations predominately within non-NBPF genes.
A few (6/302) DUF1220 domains appear to be hybrid
domains, that is, they contain a short exon
characteristic of one domain and the long exon characteristic of a
different domain. These domains were not included in
our analysis.</p>
        <p>Individual DUF1220 domains are referred to by their
gene name, the name of the clade to which the domain
belongs, and a number reflecting the placement of that
domain within the gene. For example, NBPF1_CON1_3
refers to the third CON1 domain within NBPF1 and
NBPF20_HLS1_8 refers to the eighth HLS1 domain
within NBPF20. Six DUF1220 containing genes currently
lack formal gene names in either RefSeq or Ensembl but
each of these has high sequence similarity to another
gene (e.g. LOC102724250 is very similar to NBPF1). For
clarity, in Additional file 5 and Additional file 2: Figure S1,
we refer to these genes by descriptive names reflecting
their similarity to named genes (LOC102724250: NBPF1L,
LOC100996724: PDE4DIPL1, RP11-744H18.1:
PDE4DIPL2). The three genes containing CON8 domains are
similar to one another but not to any currently named
gene, so they are referred to as CON8 containing 1, 2, and
3 (LOC105369199: CON8C1, LOC105369140: CON8C2,
LINC00869: CON8C3). In Additional file 5 we also label
some exons as conserved exon 1–7 (CE1-CE7) because
the sequence of these exons is highly conserved across
genes and, for CE1-CE3, at multiple locations within
genes. Several non-coding exons also have high sequence
similarity across genes and these are labeled
UTR1UTR20 (e.g. the sequence of UTR13 exons is highly
conserved across different genes). Exons that do not meet any
of the conditions described above are referred to as “exon”
with a number denoting the exon position in the gene.</p>

cycle conditions are as follows: 95 °C – 10 min, 40×
(94 °C – 30 s, annealing temperature (described
below) – 60 s), 98 °C – 10 min, 12 °C – hold. ddPCR
cycle conditions for different target sequences varied
only in the annealing temperature utilized. For CON1
and HLS3, the annealing temperature was 56 °C, for
CON2 the temperature was 61 °C, and for NBPF14,
the temperature was 59.7 °C.
        </p>
        <p>Within a ddPCR run, each sample was run in triplicate
and the counts of positive and negative droplets from each
of the replicate wells were combined before calculating
the copy number for each sample. Each sample was run in
this manner 3 (in some cases 4) times, and the mean copy
number of these runs was utilized to calculate the
correlation coefficient with WGS read depth.</p>
        <p>Initial analysis included 44 samples from the 1000
Genomes Project analyzed for both CON1 and CON2
copy number. Because we identified that the short insert
size of BCM samples affected the read depth accuracy,
we did not analyze the BCM samples by ddPCR for
HLS3. Two additional samples were excluded from the
final analysis, and from ddPCR of HLS3, because their
whole genome sequencing data was derived from a large
number of lanes (HG01454 and HG01139 were
sequenced across 35 and 48 lanes respectively) and a third
was excluded because it had a lower than normal
number of reads (HG01148). The final analysis included
13 samples for each of the DUF1220 clades.</p>
