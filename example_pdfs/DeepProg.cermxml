        <p>Multi-omics data are good resources for prognosis and survival prediction; however, these are difficult to integrate computationally. We introduce DeepProg, a novel ensemble framework of deep-learning and machine-learning approaches that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. It identifies two optimal survival subtypes in most cancers and yields significantly better risk-stratification than other multi-omics integration methods. DeepProg is highly predictive, exemplified by two liver cancer (C-index 0.73-0.80) and five breast cancer datasets (C-index 0.68-0.73). Pan-cancer analysis associates common genomic signatures in poor survival subtypes with extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes.

      <title>Background</title>
      <p>
        Most survival-based molecular signatures are based on
one single type of omics data [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
        ]. Since each omic
platform has specific limitations and noises, multi-omics
based integrative approach presumably can yield more
coherent signatures [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
        ]. However, this approach to
predict clinical phenotypes is much less explored
comparatively, due to the combination of computational and
practical challenges. These challenges include
platformspecific measurement biases [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>
        ], different data
distributions which require proper normalizations [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
        ], as well as
very limited sample-sizes with multi-omics
measurements due to the high cost [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Among the multi-omics data integration methods,
most of them do not model patient survival as the
objective; rather, the survival differences associated with
molecular subtypes are evaluated in a post hoc fashion
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
        ]. Moreover, many methods use unsupervised
approaches, unsuitable for predicting new patient statuses
iCluster, Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), MAUI, and
Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA+) are such
examples [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10 ref7 ref8 ref9">7–10</xref>
        ]. iCluster is of the earliest methods to cluster
cancer samples into different molecular subtypes based
on multi-omic features, using probabilistic modeling to
project the data to a lower embedding [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
        ]. Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF) algorithm is another popular
clustering method to integrate different omic features,
by first constructing a distinct similarity network for
each omic then fusing the networks using an iterative
procedure [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
        ]. It was applied on multiple TCGA cancer
datasets [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref12">11, 12</xref>
        ]. MAUI is a non-linear dimension
reduction framework for multi-omic integration which
uses variational autoencoder to produce latent features
that can be used for either clustering or classification
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>
        ]. Similarly, MOFA+ is a statistical framework using
factor analysis through standard matrix factorization to

explaining the most source of variation [

        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Identifying disease subtypes is clinically very
significant. For example, it is generally accepted that cancer of
a specific organ has multiple subtypes. Using molecular
signatures to identify cancer subtypes allows tumor
classification beyond tumor stage, grade, or tissue of origin
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>
        ]. Cancer subtypes sharing similar molecular and
pathway alterations could be treated with the same
drugs [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
        ]. One of such subtypes is survival stratified
patient subtypes based on prognostic signatures [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
        ]. Once
inferred, their signatures can be used as starting points
for follow-up therapeutic or prognostic studies [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>
        ].
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the molecular differences associated with
patient survival help shed light to understand the
mechanism of tumor progression [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>
        ]. The gained knowledge
not only helps to improve disease monitoring and
management, but also provides information for prevention
and treatment.
      </p>
      <p>Here we propose a unique computational modeling
framework called DeepProg, different from all methods
mentioned above. It explicitly models patient survival as
the objective and is predictive of new patient survival
risks. DeepProg constructs a flexible ensemble of
hybridmodels (a combination of deep-learning and machine
learning models) and integrates their outputs following
the ensemble learning paradigm. We applied DeepProg
on RNA-Seq, Methylation, and miRNA data from 32
cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with a
total of around 10,000 samples. DeepProg shows better
predictive accuracies when compared to SNF based
multi-omics integration method and the baseline
CoxPH method. The gene expression in the worst survival
subtype of all cancers shares common signatures
involved in biological functions such as mitotic
enhancement, extracellular-matrix destabilization, or immune
deregulation. Moreover, DeepProg can successfully
predict the outcomes for samples from one cancer using
the models built upon other cancers. In short, DeepProg
is a powerful, generic, machine-learning and
deeplearning based method that can be used to predict the
survival subtype of an individual patient.</p>

          We obtain the 32 cancer multi-omic datasets from NCBI
using TCGA portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/).
We use the package TCGA-Assembler (versions 2.0.5)
and write custom scripts to download RNA-Seq (UNC
IlluminaHiSeq RNASeqV2), miRNA Sequencing
(BCGSC IlluminaHiSeq, Level 3), and DNA methylation
(JHU-USC HumanMethylation450) data from the TCGA
website on November 4–14, 2017. We also obtain the
survival information from the portal: https://portal.gdc.
cancer.gov/. We use the same preprocessing steps as
detailed in our previous study [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
          ]. We first download
RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, and methylation data using the
functions DownloadRNASeqData,
DownloadmiRNASeqData, and DownloadMethylationData from
TCGAAssembler, respectively. Then, we process the data with
the functions ProcessRNASeqData,
ProcessmiRNASeqData, and ProcessMethylation450Data. In addition, we
process the methylation data with the function
CalculateSingleValueMethylationData. Finally, for each omic
data type, we create a gene-by-sample data matrix in the
Tabular Separated Value (TSV) format using a custom
script.

        <p>
          For breast cancer data, we use four public breast cancer
gene expression microarray datasets and one Metabric
RNA-Seq dataset as the validation datasets. Four public
datasets (all on Affymetrix HG-U133A microarray
platform) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO). Their accession IDs are GSE4922 [

preprocessing was described in a previous study [

          ]. For
the Metabric dataset, we obtain approval from the

described in the Breast Cancer Challenge [

          ]. The
metabric dataset consists of 1981 breast cancer samples, from
which we extract RNA-Seq data. For hepatocarcinoma
datasets, we use two larger datasets: LIRI and GSE
datasets, as described in the previous study [

        <title>DeepProg framework</title>
        <p>DeepProg is a semi-supervised flexible hybrid
machinelearning framework that takes multiple omics data
matrices and survival information as the input. For each
sample s, the survival data have two features: the
observation time t and the observed event (death) e. The
pipeline is composed of the following unsupervised and
supervised learning modules (the detail of each step is
described in the subsequent paragraphs). Module 1:
unsupervised subtype inference: each input matrix is
processed with (a) normalization, (b) transformation using an
autoencoder for each omics data type, and (c) selection
of the survival-associated latent-space features from the
bottle neck layer of autoencoders. The selected
survivalassociated latent-space features from all the omics are
then combined for clustering analysis. Module 2:
supervised prediction of a new sample; this module is
composed of the following steps: (a) construction of a
classifier using the training set, (b) selection and
normalization of the common features with the new
sample, and (c) prediction. For both unsupervised and
supervised inferences, we use an ensemble of DeepProg
models through boosting approach: each model is
constructed with a random subset (80%) of the training
dataset. The clustering and the prediction results are
combined according to the relevance of each model.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="sec-2-4">
        <title>Normalization</title>
        <p>As default, DeepProg first selects the top 100 features
from the training set that have the highest variance.
Then, for each sample, we inversely rank the features
and divide them by 100, so that the score is normalized
between 0 and 1. Next, we compute the sample-sample
Pearson correlation matrix of size n, the number of
samples. For each sample, we use the sample-sample
distances as new features and normalize them using the
rank as well. As a result, each sample has n features with
the score of the first feature equal to 1.0 and the last
feature equal to 0.</p>
        <p>To normalize a new sample (in the model prediction
stage), we first select the set of common features
between the new sample and the training set. We then
perform the same steps as described above: (a) selection of
top 100 features, (b) rank-based normalization, (c)
distance computation with the samples from the training
set, and (d) rank normalization.</p>

        <title>Autoencoder transformation</title>
        <p>An autoencoder is a function f(v) = v′’ that reconstructs
the original input vector v composed of m features
through multiple nonlinear transformations (size(v) =
size(v′) = m). For each omic data type, we create one
autoencoder with one hidden layer of size h (default
100) that corresponds to the following equation:
f ðvÞ ¼ tanh</p>
        <p>W 0 :sðW :v þ b
þ b0Þ</p>
        <p>W’, W are two weight matrices of size h by m and m

as</p>
        <p>f ðxÞ ¼ ð expðxÞ− expð−xÞÞ=ð expðxÞ þ expð−xÞÞ:
To train our autoencoders, we search the optimal W*,
W`*, b*, and b’* that minimizes the log-loss function.</p>
        <p>We use python (2.7) Keras package (1.2.2) with theano
as tensor library, to build our autoencoders. We use the
Adam optimization algorithm to identify W*, W`*, b*,
and b’*. We train our autoencoder on 10 epochs and
introduce 50% of dropout (i.e., 50% of the coefficients
from W and W’ will be randomly set to 0) at each
training iteration.</p>

        <title>Hyperparameter tuning</title>
        <p>To help selecting the best set of hyperparameters (i.e.,
number of epochs, network shape, dropout rate…),
DeepProg has an optional hyperparameter tuning
module based on Gaussian optimization and it relies on the
scikit-optimize (https://scikit-optimize.github.io/stable/)
and the tune (https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune.html)
python libraries. The computation of the ensemble of
models and/or the hyperparameters grid-search can
optionally be distributed on multiple nodes and external
supercomputers using the python ray framework
(https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/).</p>

        <title>Selection of new hidden-layer features linked to survival</title>
        <p>For each of the transformed feature in the hidden layer,
we build a univariate Cox-PH model using the python
package lifelines (https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/
lifelines) and identify those with log-rank p values
(Wilcoxon test) &lt; 0.01. We then extract all the significant

them as a new matrix Z.</p>

        <title>Cancer subtype detection</title>
        <p>The default clustering method to identify subtypes is the
Gaussian mixture model-based clustering. We use the
GaussianMixture function from the scikit-learn package
with 1000 iterations, 100 initiations, and a diagonal
covariance matrix. The resulting clusters are sorted
according to their median survival levels: the cluster
labeled as “0” has the overall lowest median survival, while
the last cluster “N” has the highest survival overall.
Other clustering methods, K-means and dichotomized
Lasso Cox-PH model, can replace the default Gaussian
mixture method.</p>

      <sec id="sec-2-9">
        <title>Construction of supervised classifiers to predict the cancer subtype in new samples</title>
        <p>
          We use the cluster labels obtained from the above
Gaussian mixture model to build several supervised
machine learning models that can classify any new sample,
under the condition that they have at least a subset of
features in common with those input features from the
training set. First, we compute a Kruskal-Wallis test for
each omic type and each feature, in order to detect the
most discriminative features with respect to the cluster
labels. Then, we select the 50 most discriminative
features for each omic type and combine them to form a
new training matrix M. We apply Support Vector
Machine (SVM) algorithm to construct a predictive model
using M as the input and the cluster labels as classes. To
find the best hyper-parameters of the classifier, we
perform a grid-search using a 5-fold cross-validation on M,
with the objective to minimize the errors of the test fold.
The algorithm constructs at first a classifier using all the
omic types from the training samples. If a new sample
shares only a subset of omics data types and a subset of
the features with the training samples (e.g., a sample has
only RNA-Seq measurement), then DeepProg constructs
a classifier using only this subset of omics data type and
features, before applying it to the new sample. We use
the python sklearn package to construct SVM models
and infer the class probability with the predict_proba
function, by fitting a logistic regression model on the
SVM scores [

        <p>To obtain a more robust model, we aggregate
multiple DeepProg models constructed on a random
subset of the training samples. As the default, we use 10
models with 80% of original training samples to
construct all the cancer models, except for LUSC and
PRAD which we use 20 models since they are more
difficult to train. The aggregation of these models
(per cancer) works as the following: after fitting, we
eliminate those models without any new features
linked to survival or having no cluster labels
significantly associated with survival (log-rank p value &gt;
0.05). For a given sample, the probability of belonging
to a particular cancer subtype is the average of the

        <title>Choosing the correct input number of clusters and performance metrics</title>
        <p>
          When fitting a model, DeepProg computes several
quality metrics: the log-rank p value for a Cox-PH model
using the cluster labels from all or only the hold-out
samples as described above, the concordance index
(Cindex) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
          ], and the Silhouette score measuring the
clusters homogeneity. In addition, DeepProg measures the
clustering stability, that is, the consistency of class
labeling among the different models during boosting. We
compute the clustering as the following: (a) for each pair
of models, we compute the adjusted Rand Index
between the two set of cluster labels (ARI) [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
          ], and (b) we
then calculate the mean of all the pair-wise rand indexes.
For each cancer model, we test different initial number
of clusters (K = 2,3,4,5). We then select the K presenting
the best overall results based on silhouette score.
Furthermore, we also select carefully the K that minimizes
the crossovers on the Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots, when
plotting the stratified patient survival groups according
to the cluster labels.
        </p>
        <p>To identify the input omics features differentially
expressed between the worst survival subtype and
other(s), we perform two-group (worst survival subgroup
and the other remaining samples) Wilcoxon rank-sum
test for each feature, using the Scipy.stats package. We
then select features significantly over- or
underexpressed with p values&lt; 0.001. Next, we rank the
differentially expressed features among the 32 cancers. For
this purpose, we construct a Cox-PH model for each
cancer and each significant feature and rank the features
according to their -log10 (log-rank p value). We then
normalize the ranks among these significant features
between 0 and 1, where 1 is attributed to the feature with
the lowest Cox-PH log-rank p value and 0 is assigned to
the feature with the highest Cox-PH log-rank p value in
the set. We then sum the ranks of each feature among
the 32 cancers to obtain its final score.</p>

        <title>DeepProg method overview</title>
        <p>DeepProg is a general hybrid and flexible computational
framework to predict patient survival based on one or
more omics data types, such as mRNA transcriptomics,
DNA methylation, and microRNA expression (Fig. 1).
The first phase of DeepProg is composed of dimension
reduction and feature transformation using custom rank
normalizations and auto-encoders, a type of deep
neural-network. It uses “modularized” design for
autoencoders, where each data type is modeled by one
autoencoder, to allow flexibility and extendibility to
heterogeneous data types. In the default implementation, the
auto-encoders have 3 layers, the input layer, the hidden
layer (100 nodes), and the output layer. The transformed
features are then subject to univariate Cox-PH fitting, in
order to further select a subset of features linked to
survival. Next, using unsupervised clustering approach,
DeepProg identifies the optimal number of classes
(labels) of survival subpopulations and uses these classes to
construct support vector machine (SVM)-based
machine-learning models, in order to predict a new
patient’s survival group. To ensure the robustness of the
models, DeepProg adopts a boosting approach and
builds an ensemble of models. The boosting approach
yields more accurate p values and C-indices with lower
variances and leads to faster convergence of the models
(Additional File 1: Table S1). Each of these models is
constructed with a random subset (e.g., 4/5) of the
original dataset and evaluated using the C-index value from
the remaining hold-out (e.g., 1/5) testing samples. For
efficiency, the computation of DeepProg is fully
distributed, since each model can be fit separately.</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-2">
        <title>Prognostic prediction on 32 TCGA cancers</title>
        <p>We applied DeepProg to analyze the multi-omics data
(RNA-Seq, miRNA-Seq, and DNA methylation) of 32
cancers in TCGA (Additional File 2: Table S2). We used
only RNA and MIR for Ovarian Cancer (OV) because
only a small fraction (9 out of 300) of the samples had
the 3-omics data at the time of the manuscript
submission. For each cancer type, we selected the optimal
clustering number K that produces the best combination of
silhouette scores and Adjusted Rand Index (Additional
File 3: Table S3), metrics that measure the clustering
stabilities and accuracy. Almost all cancers (30 out of 32)
have K = 2 as the most optimum survival-subgroups
(Fig. 2A). With the optimal cluster numbers, we
computed the log-rank p values among the different survival
subtypes of each cancer, all of which are statistically
significant (log-rank p values &lt; 0.05) and have C-indexes
(0.6–1.0) greater than 0.5, the expected value of random
models. Among them, 23 out of 32 cancers have
logrank p values less than 5e−4, highlighting the values of
the models at differentiating patient survival (Fig. 2B).
Additionally, we investigated the average number of
hidden-layer features significantly associated with
survival, for each omic data type and each cancer
(Additional File 4: Fig. S1). Overall, RNA-Seq has the most
amount of important hidden features towards survival
prediction. miRNA hidden features have similar patterns
in all cancers, with fewer total counts. Although vast
heterogeneity exists among 32 cancers, some cancers
known to be closely related, such as colon cancer
(COAD) and gastric cancer (STAD), as well as bladder
cancer (BLCA) and kidney cancer (KIRC), also share
similar prognostic hidden features.</p>
        <p>
          We previously showed that for the prototype of
DeepProg, adding clinical variables such as cancer stage,
ethnicities, etc., did not help improving the predictive
results in HCC [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
          ]. Here, we also directly compare the
performance of DeepProg vs. a simple model based on
stage stratification (stage I + II vs. stage III + IV) on 32
cancer types. As shown in Additional File 4: Fig. S2A,
DeepProg has significantly better (Rank sum test p value
= 2.4e−3) log-rank p values compared to the simple
model based on stage-stratified survival difference. To
further demonstrate the DeepProg is capable to predict
patient survival outcome beyond tumor stage, we next
focused on late stage (stages III and IV) COAD and
STAD. We constructed DeepProg models using patients
from the latter stages III and IV and compared their
results to survival difference using stage III vs. IV for
stratification (Additional File 4: Fig. S2B-E). The
subtypes for STAD and COAD identified by DeepProg are
clearly more significant (log-rank p values of 5.5e−04
and 2.7e−06 respectively) than those based on tumor
stages (log-rank p values of 0.16 and 0.012 respectively).
Moreover, the subtypes from DeepProg are not
significantly associated with the stage (Fisher exact p values of
0.08 and 0.14 for COAD and STAD, respectively). Thus,
DeepProg provides much more information to predict
patient survival than the clinical factor tumor stage.

        <title>Comparison between DeepProg and other methods</title>
        <p>
          To evaluate the new DeepProg method, we compared
the results from the 32 cancers above with those
obtained from the Similarity Network Fusion (SNF)
algorithm [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
          ], a state-of-the-art method to integrate
multi-omics data (Fig. 2B, C, Additional File 4: Fig. S3).
Previously SNF was used to identify cancer subtypes
linked to survival by others [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref12">11, 12</xref>
          ]. As shown in Fig.
2B, the survival subtypes from SNF only have significant
survival difference in 13 out of 32 cancers (p value&lt;
0.05). In all, DeepProg yields much better log-rank p
values (Fig. 2B) and C-indices (Fig. 2C). Additionally,
considering that TCGA datasets might have changed
since the time of the SNF publication, we also used the
patient subtypes identified in the original SNF paper on
five test datasets and used them to obtain log-rank
survival subtype p values [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
          ]. These p values are all less
significant, compared to those obtained from DeepProg
using the same five datasets as the inputs (Additional
File 5: Table S4).
        </p>
        <p>We also substituted the autoencoder step of the
DeepProg configuration with a simple PCA decomposition
and two matrix factorization methods including MAUI
and MOFA+, using TCGA HCC and BRCA datasets. In
each alternative approach, we transformed the
multiomic matrices into 100 new components, followed by
the same remaining steps in DeepProg (e.g., survival
associated feature filtering, clustering). While none of the
100 features from MAUI has a p value &lt; 0.05 in Cox-PH
filtering step, PCA and MOFA+ both have much worse
performances compared to the default dimension
reduction step in DeepProg (Fig. 3 and Additional File 6:
Table S5). On HCC testing data, C-indices from PCA
and MOFA+ are 0.60 and 0.59 respectively (Fig. 3A, B),
compared to that of 0.76 by DeepProg (Fig. 3C). On
BRCA testing data, PCA and MOFA+ yield C-indices of
0.58 and 0.62 respectively (Fig. 3D, E), whereas
DeepProg has a C-index of 0.77 (Fig. 3F). In conclusion, based
on the HCC and BRCA benchmarks, DeepProg is
significantly better to infer subtypes linked to survival from
multi-omics data compared to the matrix factorization
methods and PCA.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we compared DeepProg with a baseline model,
where the Z-score normalized features are directly fit by
the Cox-PH model with Lasso penalization without the
autoencoder step. The samples are dichotomized into
the same number of clusters as in DeepProg, subjective
to the same parameterization whenever applicable. On
the same hold-out samples across 32 cancers, DeepProg
shows significantly better log-rank p values (p value&lt;
0.0005, 2-sided t test) than the baseline Cox-PH model
(Additional File 4: Fig. S4).</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-4">
        <title>Validation of DeepProg performance by other cohorts</title>
        <p>One key advantage of the DeepProg workflow is its
ability to predict the survival subtype of any new individual
sample that has some common RNA, miRNA, or DNA
methylation features with the training dataset (Fig. 1B).
DeepProg normalizes a new sample by taking the
relative rank of the features and use them to compute the
distances to the samples in the training set (see the
“Methods” section). To validate the patient survival risk
stratification of DeepProg models, we applied them on
additional independent cancer datasets, two from
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cohorts (Fig. 4A, B) and
four from breast cancer (BRCA) cohorts (Fig. 4C, F).
The two HCC validation sets are LIRI dataset with 230
RNA-Seq samples and GSE dataset with 221 gene
expression array results (see the “Methods” section). We
obtained a C-index of 0.80 and log-rank p value of 1.2e
−4 (LIRI) and a C-index of 0.73 and log-rank p value of
1.5e−5 (GSE), respectively (Fig. 4A, B). The four BRCA
datasets have C-indices of 0.68–0.73, all with significant
log-rank p values (&lt; 0.05) for survival difference (Fig. 4C,
F). We thus validated the predictability of DeepProg by
additional HCC and BRCA cohorts.</p>

        <title>Identification of signature genes for the worst survival subtypes reveals pan-cancer patterns</title>
        <p>In order to identify the key features that are associated
with patient survival differences, we conducted a
comprehensive analysis of features in each omic layer that
are significantly over- or under-expressed among the
subset of patients with the poorest survival. Next, among
the over- or under-expressed features we selected
important features from the input data types whose
Wilcoxon rank test p values are less than 1e−4. For each of
these features, we computed the univariate Cox-PH
regression in each cancer type and ranked them based on
the -log10 (p values). Upon normalizing these ranks
between 0 and 1, we obtained a pan-cancer rank by
summing over all 32 cancer types (see the “Methods”
section). We describe the results in RNA-Seq analysis in
the following and summarize the results on microRNA
and DNA methylation analysis in Additional File 7.</p>
        <p>The RNA-Seq analysis shows some emerging patterns
of over-represented genes within the poorest survival
group (Fig. 5A). CDC20 is ranked first, and some other
genes from the cell division cycle (CDC) family,
including CDCA8, CDCA5, CDC25C, and CDCA2, are also
among the top 100 genes (Additional File 8: Table S6).</p>
        <p>
          Additionally, numerous genes from the Kinesin Family
Member (KIF) (i.e., KIF4A, KIF2C, KIF23, KIF20A,
KIF18A, KIFC1, KIF18B, and KIF14) are present in the
top 100 genes (Additional File 8: Table S6). The CDC
genes [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31 ref32 ref33 ref34 ref35">31–35</xref>
          ] and KIF genes over expression [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36 ref37">36, 37</xref>
          ]
have been reported in the metastasis process and linked
to poor prognosis. Many other genes over-expressed in
the poor survival group are concordant with previous
studies, such as ITGA5, CALU, PLKA1, KPNA2, APCD
DL1, LGALS1, GLT25D1, CKAP4, IGF2BP3, and
ANXA5 [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>
          ]. Using the ranking values, we clustered the
cancers and the genes and detected two clear gene
clusters, enriched with biological functions of cell-cycle and
mitosis (Adj. p value = 3e−42) and extracellular matrix
organization pathway (Adj. p value = 6e−9), respectively

such as PRAD, PAAD, and LUAD are in the other group
(Fig. 5A).</p>
        <p>
          Among the genes that are under-expressed in the
poorest survival groups, CBX7 and EZH1 are the top 2
genes (Additional File 8: Table S6). Downregulation of
CBX7 was shown to play a critical role in cancer
progression [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
          ]. Similarly, EZH1 inhibition was shown to
be involved in cell proliferation and carcinogenesis [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40 ref41">40,
41</xref>
          ]. Additionally, multiple genes in zinc finger family are
downregulated (ZBTB7C, ZMAT1, ZNF18, ZNF540,
ZNF589, ZNF554, and ZNF763). ZNF genes are a large
family of transcription factor and many of them were
shown relevance in cancer progression [

        <title>RNA-Seq co-expression network analysis</title>
        <p>
          To characterize further the RNA-Seq gene expression
associated with the poorest survival subtypes, we
performed a global gene co-expression analysis. For each
cancer type, we selected differentially expressed genes
from the worst survival subtype (Fig. 5A) and
constructed a pan-cancer consensus co-expression network.
As an illustration, we constructed a subgraph of
coexpression using the top 200 genes and the most
significant edges (Fig. 5B) and performed gene community
detection using random-walks algorithm [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
          ]. A large
fraction of top co-expressed genes overlap with the top
survival genes highlighted earlier. For example, a tight
cluster (group 1) is composed of multiples CDC and KIF
genes, together with BUB1, MCM10, AURKB, CENPA,
CENPF, and PLK1. These genes are related to mitosis
and cell cycle pathway (q value = 2e−28). Two clusters
(groups 4 and 5) that include multiple collagens are
enriched with extracellular matrix (ECM) organization
and receptors function (q value = 2e−16) (Fig. 5B). These
results follow the conclusions of previous studies
highlighting close correlations between ECM genes,
notably SPARC and COL1A1, and tumor invasiveness [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
          ].
In addition, the network unveiled two major groups of
genes associated with immunoregulation between
lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell pathway (group 2, q value =
6e−10) and smooth muscle contraction (group 3, q value
= 7e−12), respectively. Similar to signature gene results
(Fig. 5A), gene-cancer cluster map shows very close
similarities between COAD and STAD on RNA
coexpression (Fig. 5C), which was observed earlier in
features, and was reported as pan-gastrointestinal cancers
from the cancer tissue-of-origin study (Hoadley et al.,
2018).

          To address potential confounding of tumor
heterogeneity within patients, we used xCell [

          ] to deconvolute
the cell types for each patient. We then adjusted the
genes for all cell type compositions using logistic
regression, similar to what we did before [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>
          ]. We performed a
comparison between before and post cell-type
adjustment over the two sets of differentially expressed (DE)
genes using Kendall-Tau correlation scores, similar to
previous study [
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
          ]. On HCC and BRCA, Kendall-Tau
correlation scores are 0.52 (p value &lt; 1.04e−25) and 0.55
(p value &lt; 3.5e−150) respectively. The highly significant
p values reject the hypothesis that these two DE gene
rankings are independent.

        <title>Similar cancer types can be used as predictive models</title>
        <p>Motivated by the similarities observed among some
cancers, we explored if the models are suitable for transfer
learning, that is, the model built on one particular
cancer type can be used to predict survival of patients in
another cancer type. We tested all pairs of 32 cancers, used
alternatively as training and test datasets. Many of the
cancer models are effective at predicting other cancer
types (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, models built on
mesothelioma (MESO) data significantly predict the subtypes of
12 other cancer types, with long-rank p values ranging
from 0.048 to 4.8e−6, and C-indices ranging from 0.58
to 0.82. In general, cancer types that are biologically
more relevant have higher predictive accuracies of
crosscancer predictions, for example, the cancer pair COAD/
STAD, the two close cancer types identified by the
earlier signature gene analysis (Fig. 5C). The STAD model
significantly predicts the subtypes of COAD samples (p
value = 0.018, CI = 0.60) (Fig. 6B), and vice versa for the
COAD model prediction on STAD samples (p value =
5.4e−3, CI = 0.66) (Fig. 6C).</p>

further the potential source. READ shows similar top 100

algorithms, specifically for survival prediction. We have
demonstrated several characteristics of DeepProg,
including its superior predictive accuracy over other
stateof-the-art methods, its robustness at predicting other
HCC and BRCA population cohorts’ patient survival, as
well as its suitability as a transfer learning tool trained
from a relevant cancer to predict another cancer.</p>
      <p>A few unique mechanistic features of DeepProg
contribute to its accuracy. First, it uses boosting procedures that
increase the robustness of the final model, by
agglomerating weaker models from different subsets of the original
samples. This design is well adapted to distributed
computing architectures and can be scaled-up easily. Secondly,
it employs a modularized design for each omic data type
and can be extended to other omics and data types. In its
default configuration, DeepProg first processes each omic
data set individually with autoencoders, and then merges
the hidden layer features under a unified Cox-PH fitting –
clustering – supervised classification workflow. The
autoencoder structure transforms the initial input features of
various omics types into new features. Another key aspect
of DeepProg is the validation of the inferred labels using
either internal out-of-bag samples and/or external
datasets. In this study, we demonstrated the value of DeepProg
in integrating 3 types of omics data: RNA-Seq,
microRNA-Seq, and DNA methylation. Other specialized
deep-learning models to handle mutation or pathology
image data can be developed as individual modules and
added to DeepProg. DeepProg performs significantly
better overall than unsupervised methods such as SNF at
predicting patient survival. One major reason is that SNF
does not include survival information when performing
integration; rather, it only relies on the patterns from
multiple types of genomics data. Moreover, unsupervised
methods such as SNF cannot predict the prognosis of new
sample(s) like DeepProg.</p>
      <p>
        We further used DeepProg to identify global
signatures of tumor aggressiveness among 32 types of
cancers. Although previously several pan-cancer studies
used one or different omic types to understand
pancancer molecular hallmarks [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38 ref45 ref46">38, 45, 46</xref>
        ], the report here
is the first of its kind to systematically characterize the
differences between survival subtypes in pan-cancer. We
identified the top survival features linked to the
aggressive subtypes and focused on RNA-Seq expression
analysis. The pan-cancer gene regulatory network highlights
the top co-expressed genes in the most aggressive
subtype of these cancers. Many of them are related to cell
proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) organization,
and immunoregulation, confirming earlier results in the
literature on cancer invasion [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47 ref48">47, 48</xref>
        ]. Such genes are
notably linked to the cell-division cycle [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>
        ],
cytoskeleton structure [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>
        ], collagens [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
        ], or cadherin families
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>
        ]. We also found several genes linked to smooth
muscle contraction. For example, Calponin gene CNN1,
TAGLN, and TMP2 are co-expressed in different
cancers (Fig. 4). Also, CNN1, TAGLN, and TMP2 were
already characterized as prognostic molecular markers
for bladder cancer with higher expression associated
with lower survival [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>
        ]. Interestingly, various
transcription factor families, such as Zinc finger genes are
downregulated and HOX genes are hypermethylated
(Additional File 8: Table S6). Such observations are
supported by previous reports, as multiple zinc-finger
proteins have been shown to act as tumor suppressor genes
[
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>
        ], and dysregulation of HOX genes is frequent in
cancer as many of them play important roles in cell
differentiation [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>
        ]. It will be of interest to follow up
experimentally to test their effects. Lastly, through
comprehensive comparison among 32 cancers, the molecular
similarities that are clinically (survival) relevant are
revealed. For example, aggressive subgroups from COAD
and STAD, two gastroenteric cancers, present multiple
common patterns. We speculate that these relationships
can be exploited in the future to build more robust
analyses [
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>
        ] and help strategize treatment plans by
leveraging patient profiles and cancer similarities.

      <p>DeepProg is a novel ensemble framework of deep-learning
and machine-learning approaches that robustly predicts
patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. We
anticipate that DeepProg models are informative to predict
patient survival risks, in diseases such as cancers.</p>
